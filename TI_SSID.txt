Hi Jacob,
 Sorry, I didn't understand the issue at first, I believe I do now.

 In general, when there are two AP's with the same SSID (and properties like Security/Password) the supplicant should connect to the highest signal AP.
 Please check the RSSI level of the AP's and see if indeed the supplicant connected to the highest RSSI AP or not,
 If for some reason the supplicant connected to lower RSSI AP, please check that both AP's configure the same (security/password) 
 If still you believe that the supplicant behavior is incorrect, please open the supplicant debug level (add -dd to the supplicant run) and send us the logs.

 Thanks
 Shahar
